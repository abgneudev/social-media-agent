# Kiloforge: Autonomous Cognitive Agent

Kiloforge is a fully autonomous, multi-platform social media growth agent currently targeting Bluesky and Meta Threads. It does not operate on hardcoded scripts or simple cron-triggered posting schedules. Instead, it utilizes a state-of-the-art Cognitive Architecture driven by a continuous Perception-Reasoning-Action (PRA) loop.

The agent learns autonomously using a Thompson Sampling reinforcement learning algorithm to discover which content angles and niche sectors convert to real engagement, dynamically adjusting its future strategies without human intervention.

**North Star:** Real followers, measured directly from the platform API. The AI only learns from outcomes mathematically attributable to its own actions.
**Identity and Niche:** Fully decoupled into `soul.yaml`. The current configuration targets UX Design, Frontend Engineering, and Design Systems. Swap the file to retarget any domain.

## System Architecture

Kiloforge follows a Plan-and-Act Cognitive Architecture, strictly separating perception, reasoning, and execution.

### Multi-Platform Broadcasting

The `OmniPlatform` adapter delegates all read operations to Bluesky (the primary signal source) and fans out write operations to every initialized platform simultaneously. Platform errors on secondary platforms fail gracefully as no-ops, ensuring the primary Bluesky path is never blocked.

### Persistence Model

All mutable state is JSON, written atomically via a temporary file replacement pattern. This guarantees no partial writes are visible to readers, process restarts recover without data corruption, and state survives dyno rotation on cloud hosts.

## Core Modules

### FollowerEngine (The OS Kernel)

Located in `src/core/engine.py`. The central orchestrator that manages the PRA loop, the intent queue, and token budgets. It delegates strategic reasoning entirely to the Bandit and Analyzer.

### Soul and Identity

Located in `src/core/soul.py`. Parses `soul.yaml` into a typed dataclass. Validates all required fields at load time and compiles relevance signals into pre-built regex for fast content filtering.

### Persistent State Store

Located in `src/core/store.py`. Manages all durable engine state using atomic JSON writes. Key states include the bandit posteriors, action ledger, follower snapshots, deduplication sets, and the active tick counter.

### Governance and Safety

* **Rate Budgets:** Limits per-action-type throughput using independent token buckets.
* **Circuit Breaker:** Halts execution for a cooldown period after consecutive network failures.
* **Warden:** A strict two-phase safety gate. Enforces hard-floor blocking (rejecting em dashes, URLs, and hardcoded sensitive phrases) followed by LLM-driven safeguard moderation.

### Intelligence

* **Niche Analyzer:** Samples high-engagement posts, classifies archetypes, and applies exploration nudges to bandit alpha values.
* **Semantic Memory:** Uses ChromaDB for episodic and knowledge-base memory, preventing repetitive interactions and maintaining narrative continuity.

---

## Data Flow and State Management

### Content Generation Lifecycle

1. **Sense:** Read follower counts and poll sector keywords.
2. **Learn:** Mature actions from the ledger and update Beta-Binomial posteriors based on follower delta.
3. **Decide:** Sample sectors and hooks using Thompson sampling.
4. **Act:** Consume token budgets, generate content variants, pass through Warden safety checks, and execute network writes.
5. **Persist:** Atomically save engine state.

### Crash-Safe Write Protocol

All network writes use a pending-intent queue to prevent double-posting during unpredictable failures.

```text
1. Generate content.
2. Atomic write to pending_writes.json.
3. Attempt network platform write.
4. On restart: Scan pending_writes.json. If content hash exists on timeline, drop intent. If missing, re-execute.
5. Atomic remove from pending_writes.json upon success.

```

## External Dependencies

| Package / Service | Role | Credentials Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AT Protocol (Bluesky)** | Primary platform for reads, writes, and firehose telemetry. | `BLUESKY_HANDLE`, `BLUESKY_PASSWORD` |
| **Groq** | Fast LLM inference for content generation and safeguard moderation. | `GROQ_API_KEY` |
| **Google Gemini** | Versatile fallback LLM for complex reasoning tasks. | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| **Meta Graph API** | Secondary broadcast platform for Threads. | `THREADS_USER_ID`, `THREADS_ACCESS_TOKEN` |

---

## Setup and Deployment

### Local Installation

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd kiloforge
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install websockets

```

### Environment Configuration

Copy `kiloforge.env.example` to `.env` and populate the required keys.

* `BLUESKY_HANDLE`: Handle without the `@` symbol.
* `BLUESKY_PASSWORD`: App Password, not the account login password.
* `KF_STATE_DIR`: Directory for state files (defaults to `./data`).

### Execution Commands

```bash
# Dry run: Generates content variants without network writes
python run.py --dry-run

# Live run: Full autonomous execution
python run.py --live

```

### Kill Switch

To safely pause the engine without terminating the process, write a halt state to the configuration directory:

```bash
echo "HALTED" > data/engine_status.txt

```

## Known Issues and Migration Status

The codebase is currently undergoing a modernization rewrite located in the `newagent/` directory. The following items require architectural resolution:

* **Dependency Management:** The `websockets` library is required for `firehose_daemon.py` but is missing from the primary `requirements.txt`.
* **API Key Documentation:** Integration with Serper (`src/clients/serper.py`) requires a `SERPER_API_KEY` which is undocumented in the environment template.
* **Modernization Target:** The `newagent/` directory introduces SQLite-backed state, explicit job queues, and LLM provider abstraction. It is not currently wired as the production entry point and requires a finalized `run.py` equivalent.
* **Platform Parity:** Meta Threads API limitations require further validation to ensure unsupported features (like list curation) correctly resolve as graceful no-ops.
